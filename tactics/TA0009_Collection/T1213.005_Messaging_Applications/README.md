# T1213.005 – Messaging Applications

## Tactic
TA0009 – Collection

## Description
Adversaries may leverage chat and messaging applications, such as Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, and Slack, to mine valuable information.  

The following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on messaging applications: 

* Testing / development credentials (i.e., [Chat Messages](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/008)) 
* Source code snippets 
* Links to network shares and other internal resources 
* Proprietary data(Citation: Guardian Grand Theft Auto Leak 2022)
* Discussions about ongoing incident response efforts(Citation: SC Magazine Ragnar Locker 2021)(Citation: Microsoft DEV-0537)

In addition to exfiltrating data from messaging applications, adversaries may leverage data from chat messages in order to improve their targeting - for example, by learning more about an environment or evading ongoing incident response efforts.(Citation: Sentinel Labs NullBulge 2024)(Citation: Permiso Scattered Spider 2023)
