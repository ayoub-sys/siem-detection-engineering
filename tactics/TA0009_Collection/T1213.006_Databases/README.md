# T1213.006 – Databases

## Tactic
TA0009 – Collection

## Description
Adversaries may leverage databases to mine valuable information. These databases may be hosted on-premises or in the cloud (both in platform-as-a-service and software-as-a-service environments). 

Examples of databases from which information may be collected include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Amazon Relational Database Service, Azure SQL Database, Google Firebase, and Snowflake. Databases may include a variety of information of interest to adversaries, such as usernames, hashed passwords, personally identifiable information, and financial data. Data collected from databases may be used for [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008), [Command and Control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011), or [Exfiltration](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0010). Data exfiltrated from databases may also be used to extort victims or may be sold for profit.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence UNC5537 Snowflake 2024)
