# T1518.002 – Backup Software Discovery

## Tactic
TA0007 – Discovery

## Description
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of backup software or configurations that are installed on a system. Adversaries may use this information to shape follow-on behaviors, such as [Data Destruction](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485), [Inhibit System Recovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490), or [Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486).  

Commands that can be used to obtain security software information are [netsh](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0108), `reg query` with [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075), `dir` with [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), and [Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057), but other indicators of discovery behavior may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for, such as Veeam, Acronis, Dropbox, or Paragon.(Citation: Symantec Play Ransomware 2023)
